# School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
A school board has requested uphold state-testing standards to understand the extant of a known academic dishonesty as the grades for reading and math for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.

This analysis has been done by:

1. Replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 
2. repeating the school district analysis and describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.


### Purpose

To determine the impact of a academic dishonesty on the overall grades analysis.


## Results

The analysis helps us to answer the following questions:

-   **How is the district summary affected?** <br/>
     While __*average reading score*__ has no change, the __*average scores for math*__ had a slight decreased ( __*from 79 to 78.9*__ ) as well as the percentual of __*passing on math and reading*__ and consequently __*overall passing percentual*__ ( __*from 75 to 74.8*__ and __*86 to 85.7*__ and __*65 to 64.9  consecutively*__ ).  The remaining data has not been affected as it can be seen in the images below comparing both data.

-   **How is the school summary affected?** <br/>
     Even though the average score for reading and math does not have a significant change in the school summary data, it is noticeable the sharp fall in the percentual of __*passing on math and reading*__ which directly affects __*overall passing percentual*__ ( __*from 93.27 to 66.91*__ and __*97.30 to 69.66*__ and __*90.95 to 65.07 consecutively*__ ) . Please, see the following images where the changes can be observed.

-   **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?** <br/>
      Thomas High Schools's performance changed considerably relative to the other schools fourteen schools,  dropping from the __*second position*__ to __*eighth position*__ after having the ninth grade replaced.
     
-   **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
    -   **Math and reading scores by grade** <br/>
      No changes have been observed on the math and reading scores by grade.<br/><br/>
    -   **Scores by school spending** <br/>
     As it can be seen in the images below, while “**_Average Math Score_**”, “**_% Passing Math_**”, “**_% Passing Reading_**” “**_% Overall Passing_**” has a small decrease (**_from 83.42 to 83.35_**, **_93.27 to 93.18_**, **_97.30 to 97.01_**, **_90.95 to 90.63_** each), “**_Average Reading Score_**” had a raise of **_0.05%_**.

    -   **Scores by school size** <br/>
     No changes have been observed on the scores by the school size.<br/><br/>
    -   **Scores by school type**<br/>
     No changes have been observed on the scores by the school type.
     

 

## Summary

While the __*district summary*__ and the __*scores by school spending*__ were most affected on *the passing percentual for both math and reading* with a fractional decrease only, the __*school summary*__ had a considerable drop of about 26% in both *math and reading percentual of passing* consequently pushing  __*Thomas High Schools’s performance*__  from the top 2 down to figure the middle of the ranking.
